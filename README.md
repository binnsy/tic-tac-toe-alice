LINK TO REPOSITORY/GAME


My first web app complete!

Our first project was to complete a single-page application of Tic-Tac-Toe from scratch. Prior to starting, we were warned of the diffiuclty, but I thought I was prepared...I was not. I overcame many obstacles and struggles.

I first wrote out the basic steps in my notebook along with drawing my wireframe of how I wanted it to look:

I then took that and typed it into a document where I entered noted about important project requirements. From there I created an official game-project-scope-study. I was able to do an initial pseudocode to map out the basics of the events. It was then I realized I had to teach the computer to do a lot more then just the basic instructions. I followed a schedule of steps that helped a lot, but I was stuck almost right away.

My first road block came when I was trying to store my click into an array. Then I had trouble figuring out how to prevent a player from clicking a box that already had an X or O in it. What really got me was the API. Once I tried to patch my game, I had a lot of trouble storing an id and a game. My reset button also bugged my code. Although it cleared my board, it did not exactly start my logic over how I wanted it to. That was probably my biggest holdup of the project. I also didn't realize I was making small steps, so I would delete my code and try new things even though I just needed to work on the next step because everything fit together like a puzzle.

Some of the technologies I used included:
- HTML 5
- Bootstrap
- SASS
- CSS
- Java Script
- JQuery
- AJAX

Some of the things I wish I could do would be work on styling with animation, hover, colors, etc. I would also like to create an AI player. Displaying something like individual wins as opposed to just total games would be nice too. There are so many features that would be fun to add!

Although I came across many obstacles, was very frusterated at times, and bugged my code way more than I wanted, I enjoyed the process and learned a lot along the way. I accepted my frusteration and learned to be more patient. I learned to use console.log more and more throughout the project as then I was able to pinpoint exactly where I went wrong and express it in the queue more accuratly.
