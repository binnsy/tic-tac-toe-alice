LINK TO REPOSITORY/GAME


My first web app complete!

Our first project was to complete a single-page application of Tic-Tac-Toe from scratch. Prior to starting, we were warned of the diffiuclty, but I thought I was prepared...I was not. I overcame many obstacles and struggles.

I first wrote out the basic steps in my notebook along with drawing my wireframe of how I wanted it to look:

![./ticTacToeWireFrame "Tic Tac Toe Wireframe"]


I then took that and typed it into a document where I entered noted about important project requirements. From there I created an official game-project-scope-study. I was able to do an initial pseudocode to map out the basics of the events. It was then I realized I had to teach the computer to do a lot more then just the basic instructions. I followed a schedule of steps that helped a lot, but I was stuck almost right away.

My first road block came when I was trying to store my click into an array. Then I had trouble figuring out how to prevent a player from clicking a box that already had an X or O in it. What really got me was the API. Once I tried to patch my game, I had a lot of trouble storing an id and a game. My reset button also bugged my code. Although it cleared my board, it did not exactly start my logic over how I wanted it to.

Some of the technologies I used included:
- HTML 5
- Bootstrap
- SASS
- CSS
- Java Script
- JQuery
- -AJAX

Although I came across many obstacles, was very frusterated at times, and bugged my code way more than I wanted, I enjoyed the process and learned a lot along the way.
